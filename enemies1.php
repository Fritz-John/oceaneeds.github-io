        <h2>Sobek </h2>
        The Sobek is a short-ranged melee enemy that can sense projectiles and defends itself by rolling up into a ball with its strong exoskeleton on the outside. When the player hits Sobek in its shell, they will only deal a small amount of damage, but if they manage to hit Sobek where the shell does not protect his skin, they can deal moderate damage.
